#list

#list is made from []
#list can contain diff
#list is mutable means it we can change element later 
a = [1,2.2,"well o well"]

print(a)

print(a[1]) #index works same as all
print(a[-1]) # -1 will print it in reverse order
print(a[0],[2]) #print from 0 to 2 but not 2 index

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------#

#tuple

#its not mutable and works and acts same as the list
#its made from ()
b = (1,2.2,"wow")

print(b)

print(b[1])
print(b[-1])
print(b[0],[2])
