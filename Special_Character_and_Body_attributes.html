        Yo, check it, straight outta Ahmedabad<br>
Rupees&#8377; in my pocket, got the desi hustle flow<br>
Ain't no copyright&#169; to stop it<br><br>

Rolled up in a rickshaw, euro&euro; in my hand<br>
Spittin' rhymes that sizzle, hotter than the sand<br>
Got my hustle registered&reg;, for all the world to see<br>
Greater than your expectations, less than your heresy<br><br>

This ain't no amateur hour, this is the big league<br>
Dropping beats that bump harder than a spiced up sheeg<br>
Rupee rain fallin', lyrics hittin' with amp&amp;<br>
Got the streets on fire, with this desi rap camp<br><br>

From the markets of Manek Chowk, to the beaches of Goa<br>
My rhymes spread faster than rumors at a kitty show<br>
Got the flow locked down, tighter than a wrestling hold<br>
Spittin' truth bombs, leaving haters out in the cold<br><br>

This ain't no amateur hour, this is the big league<br>
Dropping beats that bump harder than a spiced up sheeg<br>
Rupee(&#8360;) rain fallin', lyrics hittin' with amp<br>
Got the streets on fire, with this desi rap camp<br><br>

They say I can't rap, copyright&copy; this, copyright&copy; that<br>
But my flow's so fire, it's gonna leave them flat<br>
Got the world on notice, with my desi tongue<br>
This ain't a trend, this is where I belong<br><br>

This ain't no amateur hour, this is the big league<br>
Dropping beats that bump harder than a spiced up sheeg<br>
Rupee&#8377; rain fallin', lyrics hittin' with amp<br>
Got the streets on fire, with this desi rap camp<br><br>

Yeah, Ahmedabad in the house, rupees in the bank<br>
This desi rapper's on a roll, ain't no stopping this tank<br><br><br>
